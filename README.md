# Image Tool

An image converter tool, so I can stop using online converters.

## Supported Bitmap Files

The following file types are supported:

- PNG
- JPG
- BMP
- WEBP
- ICO
- ICNS

### Making Icon Files

A dropdown selection is used to select what sizes to use in your icon file.

To convert to an icon, the source image must be square, and must reach a minimum size depending on the dropdown selection. The minimum dimensions required are:

- 64x64 for website favicon
- 256x256 for program icon (ICO)
- 1024x1024 for Apple icon

## Python Version

Use Python 3.13.
